package advanced

/* operator keywords lets us overload operators*/
// multiple return statement in anonymous functions gives us flexibility for multiple return point
/* inline keyword inlines the high order function/lambda to where it is called*/
/* extension functions have access to member/properties of class */
// backing field is generated for a property
// Using `inner` the nested class becomes inner class and can access properties from host class
// using `sealed` only specified classes can inherit from sealed class
// anything inheriting from a sealed class has to put in same file. sealed class has to be found in same file
// using `typealias` we can alias any type to a custom type eg. typealias Name = String
// the `by` keyword helps us in delegating functions from dependencies
/* Using @JvmStatic we can access this function statically through java*/
// delegating properties requires us to implement setValue and getValue
// `reified` Avoids type erasure and preserves the type
